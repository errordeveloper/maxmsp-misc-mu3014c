   abstract = {This chapter discusses reverberation algorithms, with emphasis on algorithms that can be implemented for realtime performance. The chapter begins with a concise framework describing the physics and perception of reverberation. This includes a discussion of geometrical, modal, and statistical models for reverberation, the perceptual effects of reverberation, and subjective and objective measures of reverberation. Algorithms for simulating early reverberation are discussed first, followed by a discussion of algorithms that simulate late, diffuse reverberation. This latter material is presented in chronological order, starting with reverberators based on comb and allpass filters, then discussing allpass feedback loops, and proceeding to recent designs based on inserting absorptive losses into a lossless prototype implemented using feedback delay networks or digital waveguide networks.},
